# LyriQ

A simple web app inspired by Genius.com Android App that lets users create custom lyric cards.

## Why Create this when GENIUS.com Exists

You can't create lyric card on genius.com but on Android app.
Not every song has lyrics available on Genius.  
Sometimes you just remember a line, know the song name, and want a clean lyric card to post.

This app lets you create your own.
